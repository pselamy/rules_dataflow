# Docker Dataflow Pipeline Build Rules for Bazel

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This repository provides a comprehensive set of Bazel build rules specifically designed for building Docker containers that run Dataflow pipelines. If you're working on a project that involves processing large-scale data using Dataflow, these build rules will streamline your containerization process and enhance your development workflow.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Integration:** The build rules seamlessly integrate with Bazel, a powerful build tool that optimizes your builds for efficiency and reproducibility. You can easily incorporate these rules into your existing Bazel workspace without any hassle.
- **Containerization Made Easy:** By leveraging the build rules, you can effortlessly create Docker containers for your Dataflow pipelines. Simply define the necessary dependencies, configurations, and runtime environment, and the build rules take care of the rest.
- **Flexibility and Customization:** The build rules are highly customizable, allowing you to tailor your Docker containers to match your specific pipeline requirements. You can specify the necessary dependencies, package additional files, and configure environment variables with ease.
- **Efficient Dependency Management:** The build rules handle dependency management efficiently, ensuring that all the required dependencies for your Dataflow pipelines are included in the resulting Docker image. This reduces the risk of runtime errors due to missing dependencies.
- **Reproducible Builds:** Thanks to Bazel's deterministic build system, you can achieve reproducibility across different environments and ensure consistent results for your Dataflow pipelines. This is particularly useful when working in collaborative projects or deploying pipelines across various environments.

## Getting Started

To get started with these Docker Dataflow Pipeline Build Rules for Bazel, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure that you have Bazel installed on your machine. If not, refer to the [Bazel documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install.html) for installation instructions.

2. **Integration:** Clone this repository and integrate the build rules into your existing Bazel workspace by including the necessary build files.

3. **Configuration:** Customize the build rules to match your pipeline requirements. Specify the dependencies, configurations, and runtime environment details in the appropriate Bazel build files.

4. **Building Docker Containers:** Use the Bazel commands to build the Docker containers for your Dataflow pipelines. Bazel will handle the dependency management and generate the Docker image based on your specified configurations.

5. **Running Dataflow Pipelines:** Deploy the generated Docker image to your desired environment and execute your Dataflow pipelines with ease.
